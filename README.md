# Game Book

The idea is to experiment with JavaScript technologies while implemeting a game book app. A user-interface has been done using:

* Plain JS
* Angular JS
* React JS

The data resides on a nosql db on Firebase.io

A live demo exists [here](http://game-book-js.herokuapp.com/).


## Development
